    "bio": "Dr. Patrick Hayes is a Professor at Oregon State University. His research focuses on barley \u2013 in its many forms and uses. His current research interests include: development of winter habit barley varieties for malting and human nutrition; the many facets of winter hardiness; dissection of quantitative disease resistance; characterization and utilization of genetic diversity; stimulating local barley production; and barley quality assessment. He has generated a fair bit of \u201cstuff\u201d over the years: he has released nine varieties, distributed approximately 11 MT of germplasm, published 132 papers in refereed journals, and authored 12 book chapters. Each year he teaches Introductory Plant Genetics to approximately 50 students. Most of them start the class with fear and loathing but most graduate with a keen appreciation for the complexity and power of genetics. He has served as Major Professor for 28 graduate students and five undergraduate thesis students.",

    "bio": "Tom Stearns began gardening at an early age at his family home in CT. Prior to completing a degree in Sustainable Agriculture from Prescott College in AZ, he began saving seeds. A hobby was born in 1996 in Vermont, when Tom began sharing these seeds with others through a small seed flyer. High Mowing Organic Seeds has since expanded into one of the leading organic seed companies in the U.S., supplying both home gardeners, commercial growers and retailers. Tom's vision has always been to create a company that would help support the re-building of healthy food systems, first in Vermont, followed by the rest of the U.S. He has also taught numerous workshops since 1996 on many topics such as ag. education, economics, community supported agriculture, genetic engineering, plant breeding, local food systems, sustainable business, investing and more. His informal, personal style, ability to explain complex issues and infectious enthusiasm makes him a popular and inspiring speaker. In addition, he has served on the board of several agricultural organizations including NOFA-VT, The Center for an Agricultural Economy and Sterling College. He lives on 50 acres in Vermont, with his wife Heather, and their two girls, Ruby and Cora.",

    "answer": "OSSI was created to counterbalance the trend towards patenting and restricting the use of seeds and the rights of farmers and gardeners who buy them. Over the past 30 years, patents and licenses and other restrictions on the uses of seed have spread to many parts of the world. If this trend continues, these critically important genetic resources may become so legally encumbered that farmers and gardeners may be unable to do anything more than rent seeds from the companies who control them. Today, the purchase of many varieties of corn, soybean, sugarbeet, and cotton seeds in the U.S. by a farmer constitutes a one-time rental of the seed for a single cropping season. \"Bag tag\" licenses prevent farmers from saving, replanting, breeding, and sharing seed that has been rented, no longer purchased. In addition, plant breeders are prohibited from using these seeds to improve our crops and protect them from pests and diseases. These legal restrictions on seeds benefit a few companies but jeopardize the freedom of others to use this critically important natural resource.",

    "answer": "OSSI stands for the Open Source Seed Initiative. OSSI has three interconnected objectives. First, OSSI is a new way to save and exchange seed that ensures the seed will remain free of patents, licenses, and other restrictions on freedom to use. This method of exchange involves commitment to an open source seed Pledge. Second, OSSI maintains a list of crop varieties that have been pledged as \"freed seed\" and provides a link to sources of seed for those varieties. Third, OSSI works to raise awareness of the importance of keeping seeds unencumbered from legal restrictions and free to be used, shared, saved, bred, and sold.",
