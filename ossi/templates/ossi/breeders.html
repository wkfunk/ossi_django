    <h4><strong><a href="http://goldman.horticulture.wisc.edu/">Irwin Goldman</a>, University of Wisconsin-Madison</strong></h4>
    <p>Irwin Goldman is a professor in the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research focuses on vegetable breeding and genetics (carrot, onion, and table beet) with an emphasis on plant secondary metabolites that have some potential value for human health and wellbeing. He has also bred numerous cultivars and inbred lines that have been used to make commercial hybrids. These are grown by farmers throughout the world. A portion of the germplasm from his program is licensed through WARF and returns royalties to the breeding program. His program currently has over 75 active germplasm licenses. Irwin teaches five courses at UW-Madison, including world vegetable crops, principles of plant breeding, techniques of plant breeding, evolutionary biology, and plants and human well being. He is currently serving as department chair and works with both graduate and undergraduate students in a variety of research and outreach projects.</p>

    <h4><a href="http://cropandsoil.oregonstate.edu/content/pat-hayes"><strong>Pat Hayes</strong></a>, Oregon State University</h4>
    <p>Dr. Patrick Hayes is a Professor at Oregon State University. His research focuses on barley &ndash; in its many forms and uses. His current research interests include: development of winter habit barley varieties for malting and human nutrition; the many facets of winter hardiness; dissection of quantitative disease resistance; characterization and utilization of genetic diversity; stimulating local barley production; and barley quality assessment. He has generated a fair bit of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; over the years: he has released nine varieties, distributed approximately 11 MT of germplasm, published 132 papers in refereed journals, and authored 12 book chapters. Each year he teaches Introductory Plant Genetics to approximately 50 students. Most of them start the class with fear and loathing but most graduate with a keen appreciation for the complexity and power of genetics. He has served as Major Professor for 28 graduate students and five undergraduate thesis students.</p>

    <h4><strong>Tom Stearns, <a href="http://www.highmowingseeds.com/">High Mowing Organic Seed Company</a></strong></h4>
    <p>Tom Stearns began gardening at an early age at his family home in CT. Prior to completing a degree in Sustainable Agriculture from Prescott College in AZ, he began saving seeds. A hobby was born in 1996 in Vermont, when Tom began sharing these seeds with others through a small seed flyer. High Mowing Organic Seeds has since expanded into one of the leading organic seed companies in the U.S., supplying both home gardeners, commercial growers and retailers. Tom's vision has always been to create a company that would help support the re-building of healthy food systems, first in Vermont, followed by the rest of the U.S. He has also taught numerous workshops since 1996 on many topics such as ag. education, economics, community supported agriculture, genetic engineering, plant breeding, local food systems, sustainable business, investing and more. His informal, personal style, ability to explain complex issues and infectious enthusiasm makes him a popular and inspiring speaker. In addition, he has served on the board of several agricultural organizations including NOFA-VT, The Center for an Agricultural Economy and Sterling College. He lives on 50 acres in Vermont, with his wife Heather, and their two girls, Ruby and Cora.</p>

    <p>Stephen Jones is a wheat breeder and the Director of the Washington State University &ndash; Mount Vernon Research Center. Stephen has a PhD in Genetics from the University of California at Davis and teaches graduate courses in advanced classical genetics and in the history and ethics of genetics. His first wheat crop was on five acres at Chico State University&rsquo;s student farm in 1977. Together with his graduate students he breeds wheat and other grains for local uses to be grown on small farms in the coastal west and the upper Northeast. He also runs the Bread Lab, a combination think tank/baking laboratory where they experiment with improved flavor, nutrition and functionality of regional and obscure wheats.</p>

    <p>Kevin Murphy is an assistant professor and the barley and alternative crop breeder in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences at Washington State University. In addition to developing new food, feed and malting barley varieties, with an emphasis on breeding barley for higher nutritional value and added health benefits, Kevin has active breeding projects focused on quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, millet, and spelt. Kevin recently released a new barley variety, &lsquo;Muir&rsquo;, which was developed in part to meet the needs of low-input, organic farmers. Kevin has been breeding spelt in organic conditions since 2004, and the two open source hulless winter spelt varieties recently released through OSSI, &lsquo;Elwah&rsquo; and &lsquo;White Salmon&rsquo; are optimally adapted to low-input, rainfed farming systems.</p>

    <p>Jonathan and Jessie Spero started Lupine Knoll Farm in 2001 with the purpose of improving vegetable varieties and offering for sale open pollinated organic vegetable seeds. Lupine Knoll Farm consists of three small fields totaling about 6 acres located in the Applegate Valley of SW Oregon. New cultivars of open pollinated sweet corn are in the works, the first of which &ldquo;Top Hat&rdquo; will be released soon, with Tuxana, Ana Lee and Festivity to follow. Jonathan also selected Solstice broccoli from mixed stock provided by Oregon State University in 2002 as a part of the Farmers Cooperative Genome Project. He selected Siber Frill kale from mixed stock provided by Peters Seed and Research, and selected Emerald Fan lettuce from mixed stock provided by Wild Garden Seeds. Jonathan is a part of the Family Farmers Seed Cooperative and sells lettuce, kale, squash, tomato and other seeds to several small seed companies. </p>

    <h4><strong><a href="https://www.cultivariable.com/?page_id=1866" target="_blank">Bill Whitson</a></strong>, Cultivariable</h4>
    <p>Bill Whitson is the owner of Cultivariable, a small mail-order nursery with the goal of preserving and breeding minor vegetable crops in order to introduce them to wider cultivation in North America. We specialize in Andean roots and tubers, such as ulluco, oca, and mashua, but also work with many other unusual crops that have fallen out of favor or never achieved it. Our seed plots are located on the fringe of the coastal rainforest on Washington&rsquo;s Olympic Peninsula. Cultivariable has introduced two new varieties of oca (Oxalis tuberosa) and has produced improved varieties of several other crops that are undergoing trials for possible release in 2015 and 2016. We intend to release all new varieties under open source terms.</p>
