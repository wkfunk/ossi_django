    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">What is the OSSI Pledge?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>The OSSI Pledge reads: "You have the freedom to use these OSSI-Pledged seeds in any way you choose. In return, you pledge not to restrict others' use of these seeds or their derivatives by patents, licenses or other means, and to include this pledge with any transfer of these seeds or their derivatives."</p>

    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Why was OSSI created?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>OSSI was created to counterbalance the trend towards patenting and restricting the use of seeds and the rights of farmers and gardeners who buy them. Over the past 30 years, patents and licenses and other restrictions on the uses of seed have spread to many parts of the world. If this trend continues, these critically important genetic resources may become so legally encumbered that farmers and gardeners may be unable to do anything more than rent seeds from the companies who control them. Today, the purchase of many varieties of corn, soybean, sugarbeet, and cotton seeds in the U.S. by a farmer constitutes a one-time rental of the seed for a single cropping season. "Bag tag" licenses prevent farmers from saving, replanting, breeding, and sharing seed that has been rented, no longer purchased. In addition, plant breeders are prohibited from using these seeds to improve our crops and protect them from pests and diseases. These legal restrictions on seeds benefit a few companies but jeopardize the freedom of others to use this critically important natural resource.</p>

    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">What is OSSI?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>OSSI stands for the Open Source Seed Initiative. OSSI has three interconnected objectives. First, OSSI is a new way to save and exchange seed that ensures the seed will remain free of patents, licenses, and other restrictions on freedom to use. This method of exchange involves commitment to an open source seed Pledge. Second, OSSI maintains a list of crop varieties that have been pledged as "freed seed" and provides a link to sources of seed for those varieties. Third, OSSI works to raise awareness of the importance of keeping seeds unencumbered from legal restrictions and free to be used, shared, saved, bred, and sold.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq3" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">What is "open source"?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>Open source is a way of mandating the freedom to use a resource and ensuring that it remains free. Originally developed for computer software, the open source model makes something like computer code, or seeds, freely available for use and provides a mechanism for that material to stay freely available. The material can be modified, shared, sold, and reproduced. Some may choose to modify and improve the material. These derivatives must also remain free for others to use and cannot be restricted through patents and licenses.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq4" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">What is an "open source" seed?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>An open source seed is seed of a plant variety the genetics of which cannot be restricted by patents or other intellectual property rights. OSSI-Pledge seeds are open source inasmuch as the seeds are available for unrestricted use by anyone who agrees to the OSSI Pledge. But in addition, the OSSI Pledge requires that any subsequent distributions of OSSI seed, or of derivatives bred from OSSI seed, be accompanied by the Pledge. In this way, OSSI intends to develop an expanding pool of genetic resources that are available now and in the future for unrestricted use by scientists, farmers, and gardeners.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq5" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">In what sense are OSSI-Pledged seeds "freed seeds"?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>On the basis of the OSSI Pledge, OSSI-Pledged seed is considered to be &#8220;freed seed." That is, its use for any purpose cannot be restricted. It is important to understand that we use the word "freed," not "free," because we refer to <em>freedom</em> and not price. OSSI-Pledged seeds are freed from the patents and licenses that can restrict use. The OSSI Pledge is a commitment to foster unfettered exchange of germplasm and the freedom to use the material for any purpose, with the single proviso that by accepting the Pledge the user commits to allowing others freedom to use the material or derivatives of the material.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq6" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">How does OSSI benefit gardeners?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>By using OSSI's "freed seed," gardeners participate directly in the global movement to maintain free access to plant genetic resources. By buying seed of OSSI varieties, gardeners support the breeders, seed growers and seed companies that share a commitment to freeing the seed. Using open source seed helps keep the food supply secure for future generations, assures broad food choices and diverse genetics, developed often over thousands of years, do not become lost as restricted seed comes to predominate.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq7" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">How does OSSI benefit farmers?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>OSSI-Pledged seed preserves the farmer's right to save, replant, share, breed, and sell seed. It is this fundamental right that is now being eroded globally as transnational seed companies push for the worldwide expansion of restrictive seed laws and intellectual property rights. The independent farmer has long been the basis of food security for local communities and in many countries is the first line of defense against hunger. With use-restricted seeds, a farmer is unable to plant a new crop without purchasing new seed from an outside supplier. Whether the cause is cataclysm or merely economics, no seed means the farmer produces no crop. Open source, unrestricted seed allows the farmer to plant again if the patented seeds are unavailable, unwanted or unaffordable.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq8" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">How does OSSI benefit seed companies?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>By selling and emphasizing OSSI-Pledged seed, the seed company makes a statement that they, like their gardening customers, care about the sustainability of the food system, the freedom of growers around the world to create and control their own seed, and the need to keep the genes that undergird our food system accessible to everyone. Moreover, just as with fair trade and organics, there is a significant potential market among ethical consumers and gardeners for "freed seed."</p>

  <div id="qa-faq9" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">How does OSSI benefit consumers?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>If we want to maintain and increase the choices in the colors and flavors and nutrient contents of the vegetables we eat, we need to buy those varied foods. If we wish to maintain the ability of farmers to remain as independent farmers and to feed us no matter what, we need to support food suppliers and seed companies that offer lines kept free for future generations by OSSI designation.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq10" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Do I have any obligation to OSSI if I make use of these seeds?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>If you choose to use OSSI-Pledged seeds, your obligation is to accept the Pledge. Other than that, you have freedom to plant, save, share, multiply, redistribute, and breed with the seeds.</p>
    </div><!--.qa-faq-answer-->
  </div><!--.qa-faq-->
  <div id="qa-faq11" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">If I sell or resell OSSI-Pledged seed, what are my obligations regarding OSSI labeling?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>The intent of the Open Source seed designation is that future generations of open source varieties, and any varieties derived or selected from open source varieties, continue to be designated as open source into the indefinite future. It is essential to the success of the OSSI mission that future generations of open source seed and its derivatives continue to carry the OSSI Pledge. Any time that OSSI-Pledged seed is grown to produce a next generation of seed for sale, and any time a seed buyer sells OSSI-Pledged seed in a quantity sufficient that there is likelihood that it will be further reproduced as seed for sale, the OSSI Pledge, should always be included with the transfer. If you are selling packets of OSSI-Pledged seed, we encourage you to include the OSSI logo, pledge and web reference on the seed packs and alongside OSSI designated seed on your web site and in your catalog.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq12" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Is the OSSI Pledge legally binding?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>We do not know how the courts would interpret the OSSI Pledge. Rather than develop a lengthy and complex legal document that might be fully legally defensible, we chose a simple pledge to highlight the spirit and rationale behind our initiative. We also feel that our Pledge has the greatest chance of being transferred with the seed because of its brevity and simplicity. Our goal is to support the free exchange of plant genetic resources and to foster breeding, seed saving, and seed stewardship.</p>
    </div><!--.qa-faq-answer-->
  </div><!--.qa-faq-->
  <div id="qa-faq13" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Is OSSI against intellectual property rights?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>Users of OSSI seed have the freedom to reproduce that seed for their own use and for sale, and to use the seed in research and breeding.  In that respect, the OSSI Pledge is incompatible with the intellectual property rights as currently applied to plants such as utility patents, Plant Variety Protection, Plant Breeders Rights, and Material Transfer Agreements that limit the rights of seed recipients to produce seed for replanting, for sale, and for use in research or breeding. OSSI is not opposed to arrangements that require sharing the benefits of new varieties with the breeder, as long as those arrangements do not restrict the freedom to use the seed.</p>

  </div><!--.qa-faq-->
  <div id="qa-faq14" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Are any OSSI-Pledged varieties GMO?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>OSSI does not currently accept material containing transgenic (GMO) components for designation as an OSSI variety. Given the on-going societal conversation around both demonstrable and possible ecological effects, the close ties between GMO's development and restrictive intellectual property arrangements, and the discomfort expressed within the OSSI community regarding transgenic plants,  we do not feel that GMO material is currently appropriate for OSSI.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq15" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Where can I get OSSI-Pledged seeds?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>OSSI is not a seed company. Rather, we work with seed companies who are interested in supporting OSSI's mission. OSSI seeds are available from a number of different seed companies, or directly from the plant breeder, depending on the variety. Please see our OSSI Seeds page for more information on where to purchase OSSI seeds</p>

  <div id="qa-faq16" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">How did the breeders who released the OSSI-Pledged varieties get permission to release them using the OSSI Pledge?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p class="Level2" >The breeders who developed OSSI-Pledged cultivars used plant germplasm that was already in the public domain and was not legally restricted. Through their breeding work, they have developed unique and novel material. They are choosing to share the results of their labor freely, with the proviso that anyone else using the seed they provide also agrees to share. Those breeders working for public institutions (e.g., Land-grant universities, the USDA) had to receive permission from their employing institutions to release their varieties with the OSSI Pledge.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq17" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Can I designate a variety that I have developed as OSSI-Pledged?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>We welcome the designation of additional varieties as OSSI-Pledged. To receive OSSI designation your variety must meet certain criteria. An application form is available here</p>

  <div id="qa-faq18" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">After accepting the OSSI Pledge, can I contract for seed multiplication production with these seeds or for a variety I develop from these seeds?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>Yes. If you choose to multiply these seeds or their derivatives for future sales, you may do so without fear of violating the open source seed Pledge. Selling seeds is fully consistent with the OSSI model. The restriction created by the OSSI Pledge is that you cannot restrict others' rights to use these seeds or their progeny. That is, others should be able to purchase your seeds and have the right to breed with them, to save them, and to transfer them under the OSSI Pledge.</p>
    </div><!--.qa-faq-answer-->
  </div><!--.qa-faq-->
  <div id="qa-faq19" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">If I develop a new variety that I designate as OSSI-Pledged, or as a derivative of OSSI-Pledged material, can I require someone multiplying my variety for commercial sale to share with me the benefits of selling the seeds I've developed?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>Yes. It is appropriate that the benefits derived from breeding work be shared back with those who invested their labor and skill in developing the new cultivar. This principle applies to scientific breeders, farmer-breeders, cooperative/collective breeding, and community-based breeding. When seed is reproduced for commercial purposes, the developer of a variety released under the OSSI Pledge may make arrangements to share in the benefits of that multiplication and commercial sale. These arrangements may take several forms, and are not considered to be a violation of the Pledge as long as there is no requirement other than sharing of benefit with the breeder.</p>

  <div id="qa-faq20" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">If I develop a new variety from an OSSI-Pledged variety, should I release and distribute it as an OSSI-Pledged variety?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>Yes. The goal of OSSI is to expand the pool of varieties subject to the Pledge and therefore freely available for usein breeding, seed saving, and seed stewardship. If you develop a new variety from an OSSI-Pledged variety you should release it under the OSSI framework. We ask that you inform OSSI about your variety so that we may include it in the list of OSSI-Pledged varieties</p>
    </div><!--.qa-faq-answer-->
  </div><!--.qa-faq-->
  <div id="qa-faq21" class="qa-faq cf">
    <h3 class="qa-faq-title">Am I obligated to provide seed of a variety I develop and release under the OSSI Pledge to anyone who requests it?</h3>
    <div class="qa-faq-answer"><p>No. The developer of a variety released under the OSSI Pledge retains the right to distribute or not to distribute seed as s/he chooses. However, once the distribution has been made the terms of the Pledge apply for both donor and recipient.</p>
